# Project Setup

This guide will help you set up the project environment and get started with development.

## Installation

1. Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the prepare script to set up the project:

    ```bash
    npm run prepare
    ```

## Getting Started

1. Start the project:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Git Setup

If you're starting a new project, follow these steps to set up Git:

1. Initialize a new Git repository:

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2. Create and switch to the main branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b main
    ```

3. Add all files to the staging area:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

4. Commit the changes:

    ```bash
    git commit -m 'Initial commit'
    ```

5. Set the remote origin (replace `<repository_url>` with your repository URL):

    ```bash
    git remote add origin <repository_url>
    ```

6. Push the changes to the main branch:

    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

Now your project is set up and ready for development!
